# **DLP Printer Slicing Program**

A Python-based application with a user-friendly GUI for converting CAD files into layered image formats for DLP printers. This project leverages **Tkinter** for the graphical interface and employs a **voxelization-based method** for efficient slicing.

---

## **Features**
- üñºÔ∏è **User-Friendly GUI**: Built with Tkinter for an intuitive user experience.
- üßä **Voxelization-Based Slicing**: Converts 3D models into high-resolution 2D layers for precise printing.
- üé® **Multi-Material Support**: Supports various slice formats tailored for advanced 3D printing applications.
- üöÄ **Efficient Workflow**: Real-time preview of sliced layers and optimized conversion process.

## **How It Works**
1. Upload a CAD file (`.stl`, `.obj`, etc.).
2. Set slicing parameters, such as layer height and resolution.
3. View real-time previews of sliced layers.
4. Export the layers for direct use in DLP printing.

## **Installation**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dlp-slicing-program.git
   cd dlp-slicing-program

To run program, go into gui folder and run MainGUI
Make sure to install all dependcies, program currently not ram or processing efficient.
All finished slices are in finish slices folder.
